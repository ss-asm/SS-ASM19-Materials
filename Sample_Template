*Title:* This Template is further to the [briefing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19l5ETeXW6ewFeC7ED96DAxnq7TOJkGgpuzvlKCosNZk/edit#) Please do alphabetical order by surname.

## *Mission:* **Clean Growth**
Choose from: Ageing Society / Clean Growth / AI and Data Economy / Future of Mobility

*Recommendation:* **E.g Reduce gray energry in new builds by using prefabricated elements created in designated areas based on expected building need.**

*Stakeholder:* Whose call is addressing this issue? If you say government, be specific about which department. If you say industry, say specifically which sector. Ideally also state in one sentence why.

How is your analysis related to your theme?
What is your research question? 
If you need to cite for context, don't waste time on bibliography, add an html link.



## Context
```{r libs message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Ploty is nice to use, but screenshot from excell with do too. 
library(plotly)
```


Your figures/tables.

Dataset you used to approach this problem. What data is available to measure progress on your problem? See [Zara's notebook](https://github.com/ss-asm/SS-ASM19-Materials/blob/master/Statistics/Statistics%201%20Zara%20Shabrina.Rmd) from the first day. Provide tables or figures from these datasets that tell us something about your challenge.

*Suggestion: Do a broadsweep of the situation first.*
```{r cars}
x = c("Stage 1","Stage 2","Stage 2","Stage 2", "Stage 2")
y = c("5","10","3","10","5")

p <- plot_ly(y=y, x=x, histfunc='sum', type = "histogram") %>%
  layout(
    title = "Bogus Buiding Cycle Descriptive Stat",
    yaxis=list(type='linear'))

p
```

Caveat to keep in mind: Reported by Bonnie once, August 2019.


*Suggestion: Then get specific with an example.*
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
