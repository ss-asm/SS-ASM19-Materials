This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
Jun=read.csv("con_18_Jun.csv")
```

```{r}
library(xlsx)
```

```{r}
Jun_mean <- aggregate(Jun, by=list(Jun$lsoa11cd), FUN=mean)
write.csv(Jun_mean,"result/Jun_mean.csv")
```

```{r}
Jan=read.csv("con_18_Jan.csv")
```

```{r}
Jan_mean <- aggregate(Jun, by=list(Jun$lsoa11cd), FUN=mean)
write.csv(Jan_mean,"result/Jan_mean.csv")
```

```{r}
energy=read.csv("energy.csv")
```

```{r}

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
